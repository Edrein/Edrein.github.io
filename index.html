                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p>
                    My life has been a series of roles and jobs where I am often left in a position of management. From working construction one summer with my father (and running the site when he was getting supplies), to starting my own business and running it for several years, to finally being employed as a normal working yet somehow finding myself in a soft-managorial position for training and overseeing night time productivity on a team.
                    While I don't consider myself possessing a great amount of leadership, I do consider myself to be a people person. I like to analyze the strength and weaknesses of coworkers, present them with constructive feedback, and help them along to boost productivity. In terms of marketable skills; I have worked in retail sales, inventory management, logistics, tax and business preperation, and problem solving.

                    <p>October 2019 - January 2024</p>
                    <p>
                        As the owner of G I Joes I worked primarily as the management and business end of the business. 
                        My only employee was my technician doing the actual work on our products. 
                        Where as I had time operating business calls both to suppliers and customers, as well as processing orders and subsequently handling the logistics of shipping them.

                    <p>
                        I am effectively the 'closing' employee. Originally I was the only 3rd shift employee, now I work an extended 2nd shift. 
                        My primary tasks are to handle the overnight deliveries to priority clinics, making sure that the clinics supplies are properly sterilized and processed during the night, and a minor managorial task of training other employees as well as being the person 'in charge' at night after the actual supervisor is gone.
